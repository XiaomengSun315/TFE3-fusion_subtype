# Fusion Genes Visulization
This repository is built to reproduce Figure 1C (TFE3 fusion isoforms and structures) in the article entitled **Integrated exome and RNA sequencing of TFE3translocation renal cell carcinoma** (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25618-z).


* As R has no convenient way to draw such fusion gene plots, I'm now working on a new project to bundle my codes here to create a new R package to meet the demands. Please contact me (<xiaomengsun315@gmail.com>) if you are interested in joining or have any suggestions to improve the plot.
