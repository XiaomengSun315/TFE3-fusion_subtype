This repository is built to reproduce the Figure 1C in the article entitled "Integrated exome and RNA sequencing of TFE3translocation renal cell carcinoma" (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25618-z).  

**Figure 1C. TFE3 fusion isoforms and structures**

=======  

\* As R has no convenient way to draw such fusion gene plots, I'm now working on a new project to bundle my codes here to create a new R package to meet the demands. Please contact me (<xiaomengsun315@gmail.com>) if you are interested in joining or have any suggestions to improve the plot.
